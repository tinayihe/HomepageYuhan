                <p>As I said in Me, I write diary pretty much everyday and I manage my own blog since my middle school.  Itried many different places to write blog such as Sohu, Sina and Baidu but I finally settled down in Netease.  I moved all my diaries to my current blog in Netease three years ago and set it as a private site. My blog  didn’t open to anyone for now but I hope I can post as public someday when I can really open myself up to  people. </p>
