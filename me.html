                <p>Hi, my name is Yuhan Shi. I am an electrical engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in New York, although I was raised and educated in Beijing, China. I am a junior currently and I have decided that I want to earn a master or doctoral degree after graduation, since doing so will allow me to explore specific fields of interest and my own potential.
I am not sure yet where I may live and work in future, but I like to travel and experience various cultures regardless. Nearly every break, I visit a location that I have not previously visited, and I have compiled many interesting stories from travel in my blog, which I have maintained since middle school and in which I post almost daily to record events around me. My old posts always invoke memories, whether vivid or faded.

                                    <br /><h5>Education</h5>
                <p>I attended my primary school, middle school and high school in Beijing, China before I started my college in the U.S. Studying in two different countries made me experience two entirely different educational system. To be honest, I had never built any circuits or taken apart any electronics devices before I came to college. So you may ask why I choose Electrical Engineering as my major for the rest of my life. The answer to this question is still in development. The heavy workload and endless pressure to prepare college entrance exam in my high school gave me no time to develop my interests. However, the benefit I got from preparing exams and solving tons of problems is my sound science background. I have studied at RPI for two years and I never thought that I would have to study in a small, quiet town before I came here. However, I learned more in these two years than in the six years of secondary school, both fundamental aspects of Electrical Engineering as well as different sub disciplines. I gradually selected some topics and now develop my personal projects for interest. I have more time to get hands-on experience in engineering fields rather than reading books and studying theories every day. I started to observe more scientific phenomenon in daily life and observe latest scientific advancements. These things that I cannot learn from books actually let me come to love Electrical Engineering and continuously discover new interests.</p>
